# Machine-Learning-Project
This project uses machine learning to predict Bitcoin closing prices for the next day. I use a dataset with prices from January 1, 2012 to April 29, 2025. This only predicts the price on April 30, 2025. This program uses linear regression, random forests, support vector machines, while I have a separate file that uses recurrent neural networks (RNN). This RNN .py has proven to be the most accurate.

The datset would have to be updated from April 30, 2025 to the day before that you would want to predict.
